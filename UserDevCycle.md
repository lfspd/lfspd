## Supposed cycle of work for "Physicist User"

- [RunDistro](RunDistro.md) to enter into the <code>"Linux For SPD" system</code>
- clone https://git.jinr.ru/x2v0/spdsft
- do the work
- from the current work create <code> a local (your own) LFSPD distro</code>
- from <code>local LFSPD distro</code> create <code>" your own docker container"</code>
- submit thousands of <code>"own docker containers"</code> to do the job

... another way 

- continuously work in Docker 
- continuously update the Docker
